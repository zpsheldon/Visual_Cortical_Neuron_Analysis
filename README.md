# Visual_Cortical_Neuron_Analysis
Analysis of direction tuning and coherence dependence of neurons in visual cortical area MT

# Overview
This project was for my Computational & Theoretical Neuroscience course at Penn (BIBB 585), taught by Dr. Vijay Balasubramanian. HW5_data.mat contains neural spiking data and experimental task data recorded in the Gold lab at Penn. visual_neuron_analysis.py contains my exploration and analysis of the data, including determining the direction tuning of the neurons and using ROC-based ideal observer analysis to compute neurometric and behavioral functions.
